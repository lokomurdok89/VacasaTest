You will need to setup a web service that can run your code and respond to requests. Feel free to use any languages, frameworks, and other tools you like - we have left this part wide open for you to choose whatever makes the most sense to you. We will send your service HTTP GET requests and it should respond with plain text answers.

Your service will need to be reachable on the internet by our testing suite. If you are running your web service on your local machine you may have networking restrictions such as firewalls to keep this from happening. A quick way to temporarily open a local port up to the internet is with the free tool ngrok.

Instructions
Requests will be sent to your service in the 'q' parameter.
Some requests are structured as questions with free-text answers while others will require some analysis to return a correct response.
Responses should be plain text.
